            <h3>The project is composed of 3 main parts:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The api which returns data representations of the terrorist attacks table data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The backend of the web app whis is displaying the data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The frontend of the app, containing the code for controlling the UI which the user can see
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Implementation details</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The API: - The only part that talks directly to the database, filtering data and returning either csv representations of the data, or JSON representations of the data.
                    JSON Representations are created through array serialization, and there is also a field, called dataSz, which contains the serialized  array internal size, so it can be deserialized and  iterated.
                    Regarding .CSV representations, the API gets the data from the database, generates a .csv file with a random unique id, writes the data from the database into it, then it sends the file to the client(by performing a read operation,  using the default stdin/stdout(which is actually the client browser)), and when the read is complete, it deletes the file from the server.                </li>
                <li>
                    The app backend - Performs queries to the API, processes the data, and generates redirects to the correct html files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frontend - Places the markers on the map and displays the data to the user.                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="design">
            <h3>General concepts for design:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    MVC design - Data acces is made through a  Singleton connection
                </li>
                <li>
                    Controllers - Get the data and creates the views
                </li>

                <li>
                    Views are independent from controllers
                </li>
                
            </ul>
